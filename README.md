Test Logic and Flow
1. Login / Home Page

Visits the main page.

Verifies that the <h1> header is visible.

Performs scrolling to ensure the page loads correctly.

2. Image Gallery

Navigates to the gallery section.

Iterates through all images in the gallery.

Clicks each image to open it and then closes it via the close button (.cerrar).

Validates that the modal is hidden or removed before moving to the next image.

3. Contact Form

Navigates to the contact section.

Ensures the contact form is visible.

Fills in Name, Email, and Message fields.

Submits the form and validates that a success message is displayed.
